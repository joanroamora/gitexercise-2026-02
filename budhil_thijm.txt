Hello,

My name is Budhil Thijm, a recent graduate
from Grinnell College. I majored in Computer
Science and Religious Studies. 
I'm excited to work with you all and learn 
in the following months!

A famous quote I really enjoy comes from 
one of my favorite manga: Vagabond
"What gets deeper the softer it becomes? Confidence."
